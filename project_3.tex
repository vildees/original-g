\begin{abstract}
The aim of project 3 is to create a code for simulating the solar system. In the first part we will look at a hypothetical solar system consisting of the Sun and the Earth. We will assume that the Sun's mass is sufficiently large, so that its motion can be neglected. With this assumption we will compute the motion of the Earth using the Runge-Kutta solver to solve an ordinary differential equations. Later we will add several other planets to our simulation, and see how the forces between the objects effects the individual orbits.

\section*{A model for the solar system}

\subsection*{Introduction}
In the first part of the project our goal is to calculate the position of Earth as a function of time. The only force in the project is the gravitational force between the heavenly bodies. We first look at a hypothetical solar system consisting only of the Earth and the Sun. However, we will write our program in such a way that it is easy to add other planets in our simulation. 

\subsection*{Theory}

In the first part of the project we will look at a hypothetical solar system with only one planet, the Earth, in orbit around the Sun. The only force in this problem is gravity, given by Newton's law of gravitation $$ F_G = \frac{GM_{sun}M_{Earth}}{r^2} $$
where $M_{sun}$ and $M_{Earth}$ are the masses of the Sun and Earth, $r$ the distance between them, and $G$ the gravitational constant. If we assume that the Sun has a much larger mass than the mass of the Earth, we can safely neglect the motion of the sun in the calculations. 

We will also assume that the orbit of Earth around the Sun is co-planar, and that it lies in the $xy$-plane. We  then get the following equations from Newton's second law of motion
$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{F_{G,x}}{M_{Earth}}$$
$$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \frac{F_{G,y}}{M_{Earth}}$$
where $F_{G,x}$ and $F_{G,y}$ are the $x$ and $y$ component of the gravitational force.

    	  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{project3.png}
  \caption{\textit{Coordinate system with the Sun at the center and Earth located at (x,y) in orbit around the Sun}}
\end{figure}


From figure 1 we have that

$$F_{G,x} = - F_G  \hspace{0.7 mm} cos \theta = - \frac{GM_{sun}M_{Earth}}{r^2} \hspace{0.7 mm} cos \theta $$
$$F_{G,y} = - F_G \hspace{0.7 mm} sin \theta = - \frac{GM_{sun}M_{Earth}}{r^2} \hspace{0.7 mm} sin \theta $$


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{project3_1.png}
  \caption{\textit{Relation between the distance between Earth and the Sun and the angle $\theta$}}
\end{figure}

and figure 2 gives that

$$ cos \theta = \frac{x_i}{r} $$
$$ sin \theta = \frac{y_i}{r} $$

We can rewrite the second-order ordinary differential equations as a set of coupled first order differential equations. 
We know that the velocity is connected to the position by the time derivative so that
$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = v_x \hspace{20 mm} \frac{dy}{dt} = v_y$$
and thus we have that
$$ \frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{F_{G,x}}{M_{Earth}} \hspace{20 mm} \frac{dv_y}{dt} = \frac{F_{G,y}}{M_{Earth}} $$

These ordinary differential equations can be solved by numerical methods. However, before doing so, we should find a suitable choice of units. We choose to use the astronomical units in our project. The astronomical unit of length is given to be the average distance between the Sun and the Earth, $1 AU = 1.5*10^{11} m$. It is convenient to measure time in years, since this better suits the cycles of the solar system. We choose to measure mass relative to the Sun's mass.

In preparation of constructing a computational solution, we convert the equations of motion into a discretized set of equations. The acceleration is given by Newton's second law, $$ F = ma $$. The change in velocity is $a \Delta t$, and the change in position is $v \Delta t$. Thus we find the q
equations for the Earth effected by the gravitational force from the Sun to be

$$v_{x,i+1} = v_{x,i} - \frac{G M_{sun} x_i}{r_i ^3} \hspace{0.5mm} \Delta t $$ 
$$x_{i+1} = x_i + v_{x,i+1} \Delta t $$
$$v_{y,i+1} = v_{y,i} - \frac{G M_{sun} y_i}{r_i ^3} \Delta t $$
$$y_{i+1} = y_i + v_{y,i+1} \Delta t $$


where $\Delta t$ is the time step. In the case of circular orbit we have that $4 \pi ^2 = GM_{sun}$.

For circular motion we know that the force must obey the following relation 
$$\frac{M_{Earth}v^2}{r} = F_G = \frac{GM_{sun}M_{Earth}}{r^2}$$ where $v$ is the velocity of the Earth. 
For circular orbit the velocity of the Earth is $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{1 year}$, where the distance between Sun and Earth is $r = 1 AU$. Hence $v = 2 \pi (AU/years)$. Rearranging the equation we find
$$v^2r = GM_{sun} = 4 \pi ^2 AU^3/years^2$$

For circular motion the velocity will be tangential. It follows that if we choose the initial conditions $ x = 1 AU $ and $ y = 0$, with velocities $v_x = 0$ and $v_y = v_{tangential} = 2 \pi AU/year$ we will get a circular orbit.  


\subsection*{Method}
To compute the trajectories of the different astronomical objects we made a vector $A$ that holds information of the initial position and velocity in x and y direction for all objects. That is our vector $A$ is a $4*n$ vector, where $n$ is the number of objects.

\[ A = \left( \begin{array}{c}
x - object 1\\
y - object 1\\
vx - object 1\\
vy -object 1\\
x - object 2\\
... \\
vy - object n \end{array} \right)\]   

We computed the time derivative of this vector and saved it in a vector $dAdt$. The derivative of the position equals the velocity, so these values we could read directly from our $A$ vector. 
To find the acceleration, the time derivative of the velocities, we computed the radius between the different objects, and calculated the force between them. By using Newton's second law we found the acceleration of each object. We then used these values in the Runge-Kutta 4 scheme to make estimates of the next positions and velocities. For each time step we wrote the $x$ and $y$ values to a file so that we could make plots of the objects trajectories.    

The Runge-Kutta solver is a method for solving ordinary differential equations for which we know the initial values. In this project the motion of the planets are described by a second-order differential equation of the position as a function of time. We want to find the propagation of this function forward in time starting from the given initial values. 

Taylor series expansion of a function $x$ around $t$ gives
$$ x(t+ \Delta t) = x(t) + \frac{dx}{dt} \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{d^2 x}{d^2 t} (\Delta t)^2 + \cdots $$

If we assume a reasonable smooth function $x(t)$ and a small interval $\Delta t$ we can approximate $x(t)$ to $x(t + \Delta t)$ as long as we know the derivatives of $x(t)$. 
When using the Runge-Kutta approximation one estimates the slopes at four points, once at the initial point, twice at the trial midpoint and once at the trial endpoint. 
$$ k_1 = \Delta t f(t_i,x_i) \\
k_2 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t /2, x_i + k_1/2) \\
k_3 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t/2, x_i + k_2/2) \\
k_4 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t, x_i + k3) $$

These four derivatives constitute the next value in our propagation
$$x_{i+1} = x_i + \frac{1}{6} (k_1 + 2(k_2+k_3) + k_4$$ 

For the Runge-Kutta 4 scheme the local error in the approximation is $O([\Delta t]^3)$. \\

To check the stability of our program for different time steps $\Delta t$ we made a program that runs over various values of $\Delta t$ and picks out the maximum radius in the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Giving the initial values for circular orbit this radius should yield $1 AU$. We wrote the $\Delta t$ values with the corresponding maximal radius to a file, and made a plot of this. \\

In the case of circular orbit we also wanted to check that the kinetic and potential energy and the angular momentum are constants, as they should be. We then wrote functions which took in the needed values for the position, velocity and radius to compute the three wanted values. For each step in our propagation for the trajectories we printed these values to a file.  


\subsection*{Results}
When running our program for the two-body system of the Earth and the Sun and for the initial values we in theory predicted to be circular we found that our program lives up to our expectations. Figure 3 shows the plot we got of the Earth's orbit around the Sun with the initial values for circular motion.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{circular orbit earth.png}
  \caption{\textit{Circular orbit of the Earth only effected by the gravitational force from the Sun}}
\end{figure}


When increasing the initial velocity the orbit will be elliptical, until we reach a high enough velocity for the Earth to escape it's orbit around the Sun. In figure 4 we see the elliptical orbit when using an initial velocity of $v = 2 \pi +1$. In figure 5 the initial velocity is increased to $v = 2 \pi + 2.3$, and we see that this is to great a speed for the gravitational force to keep the Earth in orbit. Hence, the Earth escapes the gravitational field of the Sun and continues to infinity.

  \caption{\textit{Trajectory of the Earth with a initial velocity large enough to escape the gravitation field from the Sun}}
\end{figure}


An initial velocity close to, but less, than the initial velocity of circular orbit will, as for the one a bit larger, give elliptical orbit. However, if we decrease the velocity by a certain amount, the Earth will be dragged in elliptical spirals towards the Sun. The speed of which the Earth spirals towards the Sun will depend on the magnitude we decrease the initial velocity. If we run our program for a time limit so that the Earth gets very close to the Sun, the forces working will get to big for our program to handle. We will get a case of overflow, and thus it looks like the Earth is sent out from the Sun and escapes the gravitational force working on it (as seen in figure 6).

  \caption{\textit{The low initial velocity causes the Earth to be dragged towards the Sun. When it gets close to the Sun it is sent out from the gravitational field}}
\end{figure}


When running for different time steps we found that our algorithm highly depends on the choice of step. For instance, when looking at the initial velocity that should give us circular motion, the program will not yield the wanted result if we do not choose the right time step. Here, in figure 7, for $N = 20, t_f = 2$ and the initial conditions that should yield circular motion.

\end{figure}

From figure 8 and 9 we see the maximal radius in our orbit for different choice of $\Delta t$. The analytical value for the radius is the distance at circular orbit, $1 AU$. We see that the algorithm is very unstable for too large time steps.

In the case of circular orbit we wanted to test that the kinetic and potential energy and the angular momentum are constants. Printing out the values for these three quantities we found that they all were constants, as they should be.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We have seen during this project that the solver we have used to solve the differential equations is quite unstable for the wrong choice of time step, $\Delta t$, and highly dependent of the given initial values. Smaller values of $\Delta t$ gives smaller errors (if we ignore the possibility of round-off errors), but reducing $\delta t$ also leads to a greater computational cost. However, our program was not very time consuming, so this is a cost we could live with in this case. The stability of our solver will also depend on how slowly or fast the function to integrate varies. In the case of great variance our approximation will not be very good. One strategy is to decrease the step size, and thus get a interval with less variance. This, again, leads to more cycles and may lead to loss of numerical precision. An alternative could be to use higher-order RK methods, where you evaluate the slope at more points. This leads again to more cycles, and there is no guarantee for an improved error.
